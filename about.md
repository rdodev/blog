title: About me
---

Software developer by trade and training, father, husband, stand-up philosopher. But specially I'm a fallible human being. If you are looking for my "legacy" blog, you can find it [here](http://rubenoz.blogspot.com).

You can also find me on Twitter under the handle @_MagicMissile_

See you in the 'tubes.

P.S.: The title of this blog was created in the spur of the moment while thinking about alliterations. Same goes for the blog description.
