I want to begin by saying that Twitter _can_ be a great social tool and I have certainly leveraged it that way in many occasions for work, for socializing, for coercing customer service, etc.. But generally speaking twitter has become the outlet of choice for rage, discontent and passive aggression for the "twitter collective", if you will. While it's a _good_ thing that everyone has a voice in twitter, that collective of voices, unfortunately, tends to become a place of churning strife, outrage and conflict.

While that reality might not bother some people (in fact, some appear to thrive on it), it does affect me negatively. That constant (negative) stimuli drains me, both physically and emotionally. I have the more than enough time pressures and commitments in other aspects of my life and Twitter was just getting to the point that it was affecting and disrupting those other aspects.

So, while I won't be reading my twitter time line (in fact, I have uninstalled twitter clients from all my devices), I left Direct Messages open to *everyone* (i.e. even those who I do not follow) should someone need to reach out to me.

So, twitter friends, keep it real and feel free to DM if you need to get a hold of me.
