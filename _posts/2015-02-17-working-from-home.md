Couple of days ago I began working for a new employer. Much like my last job, this is one is work-from-home-based (please note I'm deliberately trying to avoid using the word 'remote' for reasons that will become obvious soon). However, I never thought the experience would be so dissimilar. While my former team worked _very_ hard and constantly toward better communication, interaction and teamwork, it always _felt_ as if there was a big disadvantage in not being physically present in the office: interacting with people outside the team could be [difficult](https://blog.such.computer/posts/the-perils-of-no-reply/), spur-of-the-moment discussions with other groups, ad-hoc meetings, hallway convos, etc. There was always a sense of not-being-there.

In contrast, with my new employer, all processes, policies and workflows (including HR, mind you) are built not _just_ with work-from-home in mind, but rather they're deliberately built _for_ people who aren't physically present. In fact, HR itself is a geographically-distributed team.
