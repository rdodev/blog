I've been trying to consolidate my blogs from 3-4 different hosting, CMS and static site generators, however, it's a fairly time consuming and error prone process. So, for the time being I'll be posting in [Medium](https://medium.com/@walloffire) while I figure out how to best import posts from all the blogging sources/engines I've used throughout the years while preserving order, dates, embedded media, etc.
